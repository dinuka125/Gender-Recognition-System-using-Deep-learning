# Gender-Recognition-System-using-Deep-learning
This is a small application to recognize gender of a uploaded picture or video video stream(web cam)
using cascade classifiers and deep learning.

In this code first create dataset, then train the nueral network
then we input image or webcam input ,
then using cascade classifiers we identify the faces in image/webcam stream. Then we crop the faces and upload them to the
neural network and get the predicted result. And we show the result lable in the image.

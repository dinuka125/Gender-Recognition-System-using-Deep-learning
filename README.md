# Gender-Recognition-System-using-Deep-learning
This is a small application to recognize gender of an uploaded picture or video stream(webcam)
using cascade classifiers and deep learning.

In this code first, create a dataset, then train the neural network
then we input image or webcam input,
then using cascade classifiers we identify the faces in image/webcam stream. Then we crop the faces and upload them to the
neural network and get the predicted result. And we show the result label in the image.

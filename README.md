# Gender-Recognition-System-using-Deep-learning
This application utilizes cascade classifiers and deep learning to accurately determine the gender of an uploaded image or video stream through a webcam. The process begins by creating a dataset and training the neural network to recognize gender. Once the neural network is trained, the application inputs the image or webcam stream, and uses cascade classifiers to identify faces within the image or stream. The faces are then cropped and uploaded to the neural network for analysis, and the predicted gender is displayed as a label on the image. To see an example of the output, please refer to the attached screenshot (ss.png) within this repository.
